well there was this one that was about you know five blocks long it was just oh really well not five blocks but it was you know a good good size hole oh it wa they closed Hollywood boulevard for a long time it was about sixty feet by a hundred feet or something it was big and so they shut down Metrorail because you know it's all because of that theyre not doing things the way theyre supposed to and consequently the boulevards caving in and ken was working that you know so he he was laid off and he just they said the other night that he thought he would go to Japan because he could get the Japan go to Arizona because he could you know sign up and start working monday only the pay is not as good as here so he has to work overtime and it's a sixty hour week and therefore he can't come
